<p>Pronoun support added. Swap and Clear now automatically update the board. Scoreboards top menu now leads to a list
of boards you can use. Clicking names no longer clears them (which makes searching for names a little slower, but using the name field without a playerlist more reasonable) "News" updated to be easier to update without recompiling the whole app.</p>
<p>I want to add pulling down pronouns from start.gg but that might be down the road. We got team name stuff but they don't actually show up yet due to some dumb technical issues.</p>
<p>Those issues are caused by TextFit which means big usernames will be made to fit without overflowing.</p>
<p>you can now use beta.kayin.moe to use whatever in progress beta I have. Right now it should be exactly the same, but I might announce here if I have something I want to test.</p>
